# Safety Nets: Learn to code with confidence

Ruby gives you a great power, such as easy Duck Typing. As the saying
goes, "With great power there must also comes great responsibility!" It comes at
a price. We cannot afford to blow off everything when shipping. That's why it's
important to put in place different strategies to help us to catch errors asap,
but also to avoid the cruft long term. Like a safety net, they allow you to go
forward with more confidence.

Tests are one of those safety nets, and it's a good thing they are well spread
in the Ruby community. But this not the only ones. Tests cannot catch
everything, we need to set up other ones. In this talk, I'll take a tour of
various safety nets: Tests but also CI, code reviews, and static analysis. I'll
focus on the benefits they give, how they work, what kind of problems they can
catch, illustrating them with various real world experiences. People will walk
away with several actions they can take to increase their confidence in their
code.

## Why it's important?

Even it's not rocket science, "safety nets" are the product of experienced and
mature development. Nobody wants to blow off your production, or to be caught up
by legacy system. Even if it's shown their worth, it's not practiced by
everybody often because their not aware or the lack of habits. As they are tons
of talk about tests, TDDs, and CI, we should go one step further, IMHO.

## Audience

The talk is accessible to junior developer.

## Notes

I gave a simpler version of the talk at [BRUG](https://github.com/8thcolor/brug-131105) and [Paris.rb](http://vimeo.com/86134344).
