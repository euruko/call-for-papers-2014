# Safety Nets for Ruby: Habits to code with confidence

As a dynamic language, Ruby brings you a lot of nice feature such as duck typing
allowing you to do easy dependency injection. However, we won't be aware of an
error or a bug in your Ruby code before running it. We cannot afford to wait for
shipping it to know, the cost is too high. That's why it's important to put in
place different strategies to help us to catch those errors asap, but also to
avoid the cruft long term. Like a safety net, they allow you to go forward
with more confidence.

Tests are one of those safety nets, and it's a good thing they are well spread
in the Ruby community. But this not the only ones. Tests cannot catch
everything, we need to set up other ones such as code review or static code
analysis. In this talk, I'll first give reasons why, I think, it's important to
set up some safety nets. I'll then discuss each of them, how they works, what can they
catch, and their pros and cons. I'll try as much as possible to illustrate them.
As conclusion, I'll end with a "how to start right now".

## Why it's important?

Even it's not rocket science, "safety nets" are the product of experienced and
mature development. Nobody wants to blow off your production, or to be caught up
by legacy system. Even if it's shown their worth, it's not practiced by
everybody often because their not aware or the lack of habits. As they are tons
of talk about tests, TDDs, and CI, we should go one step further, IMHO.

## Audience

The talk is accessible to junior developer.
