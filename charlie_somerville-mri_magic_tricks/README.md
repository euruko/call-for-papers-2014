# MRI Magic Tricks

Join me as we dive under the hood and take a rip-roaring tour of the internals of Ruby's canonical implementation.

This talk will have you hanging on the edge of your seat as we push the very limits of the Ruby language and take advantage of a few interesting bugs to do things you never thought were possible.

You'll laugh, you'll cry, and hopefully you'll come away from this talk with some fresh knowledge on just what makes Ruby tick.
