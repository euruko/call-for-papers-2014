# Fast, testable and SANE APIs!

By now, we've all written JSON APIs in Rails. But how do you write fast,
testable and sane APIs? I'll guide you through the trials of designing and
building awesome, scalable APIs. We'll cover rails-api, activemodelserializers,
and all the associated goodness that our ecosystem has to offer.

I'll speak on the approaches to authentication, how to ensure we remain good
REST/HTTP citizens and maybe if I have time I'll share some of my top secret
beard grooming tips!

from Farnham, the town that time forgot - in sunny England. He is a rubyist,
go-nut, open source lover and contributor, and has spent the last XX years
developing the most epic APIs. When not shipping bugs, Ben can be found grooming
his beard.
